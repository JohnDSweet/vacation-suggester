This portfolio serves as the second code review project for the Epicodus program.

## Setup instructions

### Portfolio Landing Page
Create a webpage (using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and jQuery) where a user can answer questions about themselves and be given a vacation destination based on their answers.

* Include a minimum of 5 survey questions.

* Don't forget your Git commits AND README.

### Requirements for your page:

* A list of projects you have created with active links to them (either on GitHub or GitHub pages)
* For each, include a brief description of the project and what languages it uses
* An “About Me” section
* Include your background (education, job experience, or why did you decide to take a class on programming, etc)
* Your current interests/hobbies/skills
* Create a gh-pages branch so that you site can be viewed on GitHub Pages at your-username.github.io/portfolio (for example).
